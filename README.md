# SPAM-HAM CLASSIFIER
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The use of mobile phones has skyrocketed in the last decade leading to a new area for junk promotions from disreptable marketers. People innocently give out their mobile phone numbers while utilizing day to day services and are then flooded with spam promotional messages.
